# Naturally

Natural sorting with support for legal document numbering. 
See [Counting to 10 in Californian](http://www.weblaws.org/blog/2012/08/counting-from-1-to-10-in-californian/)
for the motivations to make this library.

I got most of this code from an open source project, but I forget which. (!) I then made
a few changes to handle the particular types of numbers that come up in statutes, such
as *1, 1a, 2, etc.*
